   There are many risks of network attacks under the Internet environment. Internet Security is a vital issue and therefore, the intrusion detection is one major research problem for business and personal networks to resist external attacks.
 A Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is a software application that monitors the network or system activities for malicious activities and unauthorized access to devices. The goal of designing a NIDS is to protect dataâ€™s confidentiality and integrity.
 Our project focuses on these issues with the help of supervised Machine Learning algorithm To learn the patterns of the attacks, NSL-KDD dataset has been used.
